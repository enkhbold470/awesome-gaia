# Awesome GAIA [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome AMD GAIA projects, tools, tutorials, and resources.

[GAIA (Generative AI Is Awesome)](https://github.com/amd/gaia) is an open-source solution designed for the quick setup and execution of generative AI applications on local PC hardware. It enables fast and efficient execution of LLM-based applications using a hybrid hardware approach that combines the AMD Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and Integrated Graphics Processing Unit (iGPU) in Ryzen-AI PCs.
